Using the Schema Registry API, a schema is visible for arrivals and turnstile events.

Kafka Consumer

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Messages are consumed from Kafka

Stations, status, and weather data appear and update in the Transit Status UI.

Stations data is consumed from the beginning of the topic

All Blue, Green, and Red Line stations appear in the Transit Status UI.

Kafka REST Proxy

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Kafka REST Proxy successfully delivers messages to the Kafka Topic

Using the kafka-console-consumer, weather messages are visible in the weather topic and are regularly produced as the simulation runs.

Messages produced to the Kafka REST Proxy include a value schema

Using the Kafka Schema Registry REST API, a schema is defined for the weather topic.

Kafka Connect

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Kafka Connect successfully loads Station data from Postgres to Kafka

Using the kafka-console-consumer, all stations defined in Postgres are visible in the stations topic.

Kafka Connect is configured to define a Schema

Using the Kafka Connect REST API, the Kafka Connect configuration is configured to use JSON for both key and values.

Using the Schema Registry REST API, the schemas for stations key and value are visible.

Using the Kafka Connect REST API, the Kafka Connect configuration uses an incrementing ID, and the ID is configured to be stop_id.

Faust Streams

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
The Faust application ingests data from the stations topic

A consumer group for Faust is created on the Kafka Connect Stations topic.

Data is translated correctly from the Kafka Connect format to the Faust table format

Data is ingested in the Station format and is then transformed into the TransformedStation format.

Transformed Station Data is Present for each Station ID in the Kafka Topic

A topic is present in Kafka with the output topic name the student supplied. Inspecting messages in the topic, every station ID is represented.

KSQL

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Turnstile topic is translated into a KSQL Table

Using the KSQL CLI, turnstile data is visible in the table TURNSTILE.

Turnstile table is aggregated into a summary table

Using the KSQL CLI, verify that station IDs have an associated count column.
